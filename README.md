### Hello! 👋🏽

I am a full-stack software engineer and former product manager. In my 8+ years as a PM, I worked side-by-side with engineers, while also building and honing my own technical skillset. I made the transition into software engineering because I wanted to play a more hands-on role in solving technical challenges and building solutions to user problems.

I co-created and built 🥥 Colada [[website](https://colada.dev/)] [[repo](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/colada)], an open-source Vue DevTools plugin and companion Chrome Extension to enable time-travel debugging for Vue apps that use Pinia state management.

Some other things about me:
* I have a dog named Toby. 🐶 <-- and he actually looks like this emoji
* I use Neovim and enjoy fiddling with [my configs](https://github.com/bvaughnsulit/dotfiles).
* I build and collect custom mechanical keyboards.
